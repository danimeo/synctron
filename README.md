# :zap: Synctron: a personal activity manager 

Temporarily aimed for my personal use. Try, fork and contribution is welcomed.

[Debugging / testing version on gitee.com](https://gitee.com/danimeo/synctron)

Functions to be implemented:

*Logging*, *analysis* and *management* of personal activities varying from basic, life-sustaining skills (such as eating, sleeping and self-medication on time) to big tasks in work, study, social communication, etc.

1. Unnoticeably automatic logging (as a prerequisite for analysis and scheduling).
2. Put all the information and resources you need in one place to complete a routine. This can be useful to people with ADHD, who have minimal attention range and span frequently or constantly.
3. Smart scheduling and planning. Most times you would just need to trust the system.


Never stop trying to take more control of yourself! :smile:
